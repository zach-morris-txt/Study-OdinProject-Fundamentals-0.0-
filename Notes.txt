[GIT WORKFLOW REVIEW]
    Create new repository in GitHub and clone down (assuming new project)
        git clone 'repository-clone-link'
    Enter repository project folder
        cd 'repository-directory-name'
    Typical to establish a new branch for each feature to avoid clutter on 'main'
        git branch -m 'name-of-branch'
    Add changes and commit them with descriptive message *commit at every significant development*
        git add .   AND    git commit -m "message"
    Push commits up to GitHub
        git push origin head
    Pull request
    **Resolve conflicts
    **Typical development automation/tests
    ******CRITICAL SKILL: Code review  --> Merge
    Merge available only after development team approval

[GIT WORKFLOW REVIEW, LOCAL CODE]
    Within root directory of project, initialize git repository
        git init -b main
    Add files such that they are staged for commit
        git add .
    Commit files
        git commit -m "message"
    Create new repository within GitHub *without initializing to avoid issues*
    Copy remote respoitory URL (HTTPS typically)
    Connect local to repository URL
        git remote add origin 'copied URL'
    Verify
        git remote -Verify
    Push changes
        git push origin main

[HELPFUL]
    Check condition of repository and commits *items in red are not yet staged*
        git status
        git log
    Add specific items
        git add 'name-of-item'
    Add file in directory using terminal
        touch 'name-of-file.file-extension'
